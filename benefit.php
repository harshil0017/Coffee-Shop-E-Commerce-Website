               <h2>What is Ginger Tea</h2>
               <p>
                Ginger tea is made by infusing dried or fresh ginger in hot water for a few minutes,
                 allowing the oils of the ginger to infuse into the water before drinking.
                Ginger tea has a warming, slightly spicy taste. You can make your own by grating or slicing fresh ginger into a mug, 
                or buy it as dried, loose pieces or in tea bags.

               <h2>What are the 5 main health benefits of ginger tea?</h2>
               <br>
               
               <h3>May help to ease digestive discomfort</h3>
               <p>Ginger tea is probably most well-known for its potential to soothe digestive issues,
                  and in particular for helping ease nausea. One study even suggests it may be just as effective as some medications,
                  but with fewer side effects, in the case of morning sickness.
                </p>
                <br>

                <h3>Anti-inflammatory</h3>
                <p>Ginger contains key phytonutrients known as gingerols, and research has shown that these can have an antimicrobial
                     and anti-inflammatory effect which, when drunk as a tea, may help support a healthy microbiome.
                </p>
                <br>

                <h3>May help to reduce blood pressure</h3>
                <p>A 2017 study found that those who consume ginger on a daily basis had a decreased risk of hypertension.
                     While the study didn’t look specifically at ginger tea, it may be useful to consume ginger tea if you have high blood pressure.
                </p>
                <br>

                <h3>May aid weight loss</h3>
                <p>There have been a few studies into the benefits of ginger when it comes to weight and obesity.
                     A review of this research highlighted that ginger may have a positive impact on obesity through a number of different mechanisms,
                      including appetite control and increasing thermogenesis (heat production). Again, this research is not specific to ginger tea, 
                      but it may be beneficial to include ginger tea as part of a balanced diet.
                </p>
                <br>

                <h3>Ease headaches and migraines</h3>
                <p>There’s been a fair amount of research into ginger and its pain-relieving properties, including its potential benefit for those who struggle with headaches and migraines. 
                    Drinking ginger tea, therefore, may also help both prevent and relieve headaches.
